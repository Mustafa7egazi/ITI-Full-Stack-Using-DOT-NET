# 🚀 ITI Full Stack using .NET - ICC Tasks Repository

Welcome to my master repository! 👋  
This repo serves as the central hub for all tasks, projects, and learning materials from the **Intensive Code Camp (ICC)** by the **Information Technology Institute (ITI)**.

Here, you’ll find everything I’ve worked on during the Full Stack .NET Bootcamp — from fundamentals to full-fledged web applications.

## 📌 Overview

Each folder in this repository represents a specific course/module in the bootcamp. Inside, you’ll find structured content: tasks, mini-projects, notes, and checkpoints.  
This repo is not just for tracking my progress — it’s a reflection of my hands-on experience and growth as a developer.
